# EggTimer
Modern Egg Timer Cooker is a simple web app to time eggs: soft (4 min), medium (6 min), or hard (10 min). Pick a type, see its image (runny, creamy, or firm yolk), and start the countdown. A progress ring fills up, the screen flashes, and it beeps when done. Mobile-ready, no extras needed.
